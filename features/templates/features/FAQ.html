              Q: Can we keep money in a conventional bank just for safety without using the interest?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-slate-700">
              <p>
                Yes, keeping money in a conventional bank purely for safekeeping is allowed in necessity, provided the interest earned is neither used nor kept, but given away to charity without the intention of reward.<br><br>
                <strong>Reference:</strong> Mufti Taqi Usmani, <em>Contemporary Fatawa</em><br>
                “If one is compelled to deposit money in an interest-based bank for security, the interest must be given away to the poor without seeking reward.”

              Q: What should a Muslim do with interest money accidentally received?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-slate-700">
              <p>
                Interest money should be disposed of by giving it to the poor or for public welfare, without the intention of earning reward, as it's not pure income.<br><br>
                <strong>Reference:</strong> <em>Fatawa-e-Rahimiyyah, Vol. 3</em><br>
                "Such wealth should be discarded by giving it to the needy or in public welfare, without intention of sadaqah."

              Q: If a Muslim’s salary is deposited in an interest-bearing account by default, what should they do?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-slate-700">
              <p>
                The individual should transfer the salary to a Shariah-compliant account if available, and ensure any interest accumulated is removed and donated without expecting reward.<br><br>
                <strong>Reference:</strong> <em>Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami (OIC), Resolution 1999</em><br>
                "One must separate clean earnings from unlawful additions and remove the latter."

              Q: Is using interest money to pay government taxes or utility bills allowed?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-slate-700">
              <p>
                No, using interest money to pay personal or obligatory dues like taxes or bills is not permissible. It should be given to the poor or for non-personal public use.<br><br>
                <strong>Reference:</strong> <em>Fiqh al-Mu'amalat by Mufti Muhammad Shafi</em><br>
                "It is not permissible to use Riba-based income for personal obligations."

              Q: Can a Shariah-compliant bank partner with a conventional bank for infrastructure (e.g., ATMs)?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content text-slate-700">
              <p>
                Yes, as long as the partnership is limited to permissible services (e.g., cash withdrawal) and does not involve sharing in interest-based transactions.<br><br>
                <strong>Reference:</strong> <em>AAOIFI Standard No. 6 (Shirkah)</em><br>
                “Permissible cooperation is allowed in areas where the core activity remains halal.”
